# Blockchain

This repo is a simple blockchain implemented using a linked list based on the
information given to us in the IB Computer Science HL couse.

## Running the program

Currently to operate the script requires only hashlib which is preinstalled
on python3. To execute, either run the script directly through python with:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Or how it's been intended to run by making it executable and then running
it from the command line as a binary.

```bash
chmod a+x ./main.py
./main.py
```
